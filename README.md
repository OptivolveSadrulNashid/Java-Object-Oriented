# Java-Object-Oriented
This is about testing knowledge on OOP concepts.
There are 4 main pillars in OOP concepts which are
1. Abstraction.
2. Encapsulation.
3. Inheritance.
4. Polymorphism.

This code is about a parking lot which shows which spots are available or unavailable for parking. So, I need to design a parking lot with OOP. 

*Test case:  Say there's a parking lot with 48 available spaces: 10 large regular spaces, 24 medium regular spaces, nine small regular spaces, and five medium handicap spaces. Now, let's say we get the following order of cars. We get 6 handicap cars, 8 regular trucks, 3 regular cars, 1 handicap truck, 1 regular truck, 1 handicap truck, 3 regular bikes, and 1 car. After all of the cars are inserted, we should have some information in the console. This printout can be generated at the end of all of your insertions, or as you we move along. Finally, check if the parking lot is full. 

--Hint: it shouldn't be. Feel free to make up more of your own test cases as you go. Good luck.
